# Literature Survey

Sales Data Analytics usually has few main categories

- **Descriptive: What happened?** Descriptive analytics entails tracking historical sales data—revenue, number of users, etc.—so you can make comparisons and better understand what’s currently happening.
- **Diagnostic: Why did it happen?** Diagnostic analytics is examining and drilling down into the data to determine exactly why something occurred
- **Predictive: What’s going to happen?** Predictive analytics is taking what you’ve learned about past sales and using it to gauge patterns and trends. This allows you to make educated predictions.
- **Prescriptive: What’s the best solution or action?** Prescriptive analytics involves assessing all the data and recommending the best plan of action.
